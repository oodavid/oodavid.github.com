<p>Designed to integrate with existing workload pages to add realtime multi-user task management. Fast, graceful and decoupled.</p>
<p>Written using <a href="nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">Socket.io</a> - any website can include the <strong>tasknote.js</strong> file to add some great features to the page!</p>
<p>The project is completely stand-alone; it is a &quot;graceful enhancement&quot; to commercial todo lists and workload pages.</p>
