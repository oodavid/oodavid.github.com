<p>NexGen is a Business Operating System (BOS) that powers Lucion Environmental Ltd. I architected the core system over a 12 month period with ongoing developments to further enhance it's value.</p>
<p>In this short case study I will explain how Lucion struggled with their piecemeal software, how a solution was designed, the basics of execution and our long-term strategy.</p>
<h2>Landing the Job</h2>
<p>In 2012 I was asked to consult with Lucion in reviewing off-the-shelf software packages to find a best-fit solution for their business.</p>
<p>They had been interviewing local software companies and reviewing off the shelf software for several months before they invited me... in a programmer capacity.</p>
<h2>Identifying the Problem</h2>
<p>The first port of call was to dissect their business, to have an &quot;in the round&quot; understanding of how it operated. This process took around 2 man-months (yes, that long).</p>
to review each department, the employees in their different capacities, we uncovered</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>After a long period of growth, we needed to invest in our core technologies to help the business thrive and continue to grow.</p>
	<p>We searched for a &quot;golden egg&quot; to address our needs - our conclusion was that off the shelf solutions were outdated or too complex.</p>
	<p>Having seen our peers struggle with these solutions we decided to set up an IT department and create our own.</p>

<h2>Case Study - NexGen Asbestos</h2>
<p>Lucion Environmental Ltd. are an asbestos management company with a national presence in the UK and western Europe. I have worked closely with Lucion since 2011 to create a software solution to help run their business, from the <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> to the final Invoice and all the work in between.</p>

<p>You might find this hard to believe, but this system took only 18 months to create. In fact, we had it deployed internally after just 11 months:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>interrogations and planning</dd>
	<dt>5 months</dt>
		<dd>soft launch</dd>
	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>company-wide adoption</dd>
	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>old system turned off</dd>
	<dt>6 months</dt>
		<dd>all processes integrated</dd>
	<dt>The future</dt>
		<dd>we are working on a market-changer!</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has been one of my proudest achievements; the system is as complex as the business itself. Thanks to an extended period of planning we've yet to encounter any show-stoppers or major problems along the way.</p>

<h3>EDUF - Enough-Design-Up-Front</h3>
<p>In the beginning I was given a single, monstrous spreadsheet compiled by internal stakeholders - it was believed that knowing all the variables was enough to create the solutions to their problems. I could have &quot;solved&quot; this spreadsheet with any number of off-the-shelf products, but they had enough of those already!</p>
<p>It became apparent that the problems stemmed from a lack of transparency: each staff member had their own terminology, processes and knowledge - it was difficult to know where responsibility (or blame) lay for any given task.</p>
<p>I meticulously documented all of the problems and issues that we encountered, until I had a true understanding of the company, its dynamics and needs.</p>
<p>Using this list we created a mind-map of problems and interlinked common issues, from this there was a fortnight of paper-hacking, a minimum viable product designed and a long-term vision was formed.</p>

<p>We worked tirelessly to remove every painful issue from the company. We now have a single software solution that encompasses almost every aspect of the business:</p>
