  <p>Screen recording in the browser using only Javascript. A demo site that shows off cutting edge browser technology, worth a look!</p>

<p>Screen recording in the browser using only Javascript.</p>
<p>This is a simple sketching app that records the screen, captures the microphone and spits out a video. All in Javascript.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the state of Javascript, this is a <em>cutting-edge</em> technique. Normally to record the screen you would need to download specialist software - but <strong>not</strong> with the technique I have used here!</p>
<p>I was initially concerned that screen recording would be impossible, but a quick search led me to a couple of great projects:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC">RecordRTC</a> - for recording videos in the browser</li>
	<li><a href="https://bgrins.github.io/videoconverter.js/">videoconverter.js</a> - a javascript port of ffmpeg, for merging and converting seperate video and audio streams</li>
</ul>
<p>Standing on the shoulders of these giants, I created <a href="https://draw.oodavid.com/">khan-draw</a>!</p>
