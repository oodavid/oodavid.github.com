# NGINX Config File
#
#   I want to keep this under version control instead of rogue on the server.
#   I'm using nginx's reverse-proxy feature to serve multiple nodejs sites
#    on a single server, it routes each domain to a different local port with
#    a nodejs app sitting on the other side.
#
#   Assuming the server is running Amazon Linux, just make sure that there's
#    a symlink to this file in the nginx config folder:
#
#       cd /etc/nginx/conf.d/
#       sudo ln -s /home/ec2-user/oodavid.com/nginx.oodavid.com.conf .
#
#   ...if this file is updated and pushed to the server the settings will not
#    take effect until nginx reloads the configs:
#
#       sudo nginx -s reload
#
# NOTES
#
#   This is serving a static site generated by jekyll, thus `jekyll build`
#    needs to be run on my local machine prior to git push.
