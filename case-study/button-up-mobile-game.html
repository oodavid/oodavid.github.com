<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
<p>I made the mobile game Button Up! during a sabatical from my freelance work. The game is <strong>complete</strong> but never gained traction due to a lack of marketing. This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aoy112Zt1aAylSnO0Gm8IkEhQ5nPouevQMChI61oE50/pub" target="_blank">Google Document</a> gives a breakdown of most of the major components of the game.</p>
<p>It's a long document... so you could just <a href="http://buttonupgame.com/" target="_blank">play the game here</a>...</p>
