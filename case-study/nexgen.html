<h2>Case Study - NexGen Asbestos</h2>
<p>Lucion Environmental Ltd. are an asbestos management company with a national presence in the UK and western Europe. I have worked closely with Lucion since 2011 to create a software solution to help run their business, from the <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management">CRM</abbr> to the final Invoice and all the work in between.</p>

<p>You might find this hard to believe, but this system took only 18 months to create. In fact, we had it deployed internally after just 11 months:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This has been one of my proudest achievements; the system is as complex as the business itself. Thanks to an extended period of planning we've yet to encounter any show-stoppers or major problems along the way.</p>

<h3>EDUF - Enough-Design-Up-Front</h3>
<p>In the beginning I was given a single, monstrous spreadsheet compiled by internal stakeholders - it was believed that knowing all the variables was enough to create the solutions to their problems. I could have &quot;solved&quot; this spreadsheet with any number of off-the-shelf products, but they had enough of those already!</p>
<p>It became apparent that the problems stemmed from a lack of transparency: each staff member had their own terminology, processes and knowledge - it was difficult to know where responsibility (or blame) lay for any given task.</p>
<p>I meticulously documented all of the problems and issues that we encountered, until I had a true understanding of the company, its dynamics and needs.</p>
<p>Using this list we created a mind-map of problems and interlinked common issues, from this there was a fortnight of paper-hacking, a minimum viable product designed and a long-term vision was formed.</p>

<p>We worked tirelessly to remove every painful issue from the company. We now have a single software solution that encompasses almost every aspect of the business:</p>
