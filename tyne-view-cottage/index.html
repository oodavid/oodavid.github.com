<p>This work-exchange project was profitable for us both. Shelly gained her web-presence and started taking bookings, while I was given a weeks free use of the cottage.</p>
<p>Furthermore this was a great excuse to try the GitHub Jekyll servers. I now use Jekyll in many of my projects to keep processing to a minimum.</p>
