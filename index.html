	<p>Hello and welcome.</p>
	<p>I am David King; I specialise in writing online software, solving complex problems and doing good things. My <a href="/cv.html">technical skills</a> are broad and well suited to the online space.</p>

<!-- Work Ethic -->
<h1>Work Ethic</h1>
<p>To produce fantastic software you <strong>cannot</strong> take your clients' requests on face value.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot; ~ <strong>To Kill a Mockingbird</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many programmers will focus solely on a technical problem and fail to interrogate their clients' wishes from a business perspective. I have made it my mantra to continually learn about each clients company as though it were my own.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I present myself not as a programmer, but as a software engineer with specialist knowledge.</p>

<p>You might find this hard to believe, but this system took only 18 months to create. In fact, we had it deployed internally after just 11 months:</p>

	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>interrogations and planning</dd>
	<dt>5 months</dt>
		<dd>soft launch</dd>
	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>company-wide adoption</dd>
	<dt>3 months</dt>
		<dd>old system turned off</dd>
	<dt>6 months</dt>
		<dd>all processes integrated</dd>
	<dt>The future</dt>
		<dd>we are working on a market-changer!</dd>

	<p>&quot;It would take us 12 man-years to deliver what David has achieved in just 18 months. I'm astounded&quot; ~ <strong>Microsoft Manager</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been one of my proudest achievements; the system is as complex as the business itself. Thanks to an extended period of planning we've yet to encounter any show-stoppers or major problems along the way.</p>
<!-- EDUF -->
<h3>EDUF - Enough-Design-Up-Front</h3>
<p>In the beginning I was given a single, monstrous spreadsheet compiled by internal stakeholders - it was believed that knowing all the variables was enough to create the solutions to their problems. I could have &quot;solved&quot; this spreadsheet with any number of off-the-shelf products, but they had enough of those already!</p>
<p>It became apparent that the problems stemmed from a lack of transparency: each staff member had their own terminology, processes and knowledge - it was difficult to know where responsibility (or blame) lay for any given task.</p>
<p>I meticulously documented all of the problems and issues that we encountered, until I had a true understanding of the company, its dynamics and needs.</p>
<p>Using this list we created a mind-map of problems and interlinked common issues, from this there was a fortnight of paper-hacking, a minimum viable product designed and a long-term vision was formed.</p>
