<!-- Quick Bio -->
<blockquote>
	<img src="/assets/people/david_king.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="David King">
	<p>Hello and welcome.</p>
	<p>I am David King; a full-stack developer and IT consultant for hire. I specialise in business-oriented software and mobile apps. My <a href="/cv/">technical skills</a> are broad and well suited to the online space.</p>
	<p>My systems have helped numerous companies run efficiently and to profit; from Advertising Agencies to Personal Trainers, Building Surveyors and Fleet Management specialists.</p>

<!-- Work Ethic -->
<h2>Work Ethic</h2>
<p>When proposing software solutions for business, it is rarely enough to take client requests at face value. I strongly believe that a deep understanding of my clients business and goals is necessary to create software that is fit-for-purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot;</p>
	<cite>Atticus Finch, To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Many software-engineers will focus solely on technical problems and fail to fully explore their clients' wishes from a business perspective. I have made it my mantra to continually learn about my clients' companies as though they were my own, immersing myself in the day-to-day working of each company. This enables me to create streamlined, tailor-made processes that help businesses grow and profit.</p>
<p>I present myself not as a "software-engineer", but as a business consultant with specialist knowledge in programming.</p>
<!-- Supplementary Knowledge -->
<h2>Supplementary Knowledge</h2>
<p>During the course of my career, I've accumulated a breadth of knowledge in many disparate subjects; each serving to enhance my abilities to deliver fit-for-purpose software.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Business processes, division of labour</li>
	<li>Surveying, floorplanning, interior architecture</li>
	<li>Double-entry bookkeeping, accounting, finance, debt recovery</li>
	<li>Corrosion, surface treatment and protective coatings</li>
	<li>Psychology, cognitive biases</li>
	<li>Game theory, genetic algorithms</li>
	<li>Virtual stock markets</li>
	<li><em>I could go on...</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This reflects the clients I've worked with, and those I wish to work with in the future - I'm genuinely thrilled to &quot;skill up&quot; in new areas.</p>
<!-- Practical Skills -->
<h2>Practical Skills</h2>
<p>I've tinkered with languages, frameworks and conventions too numerous to mention, but I do have <a href="/cv/">an online CV</a> for you to pore over, be warned though, it gets pretty geeky.</p>
