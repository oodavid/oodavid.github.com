	Dark Triad Business Management"
		Can we use Dark Triad traits in software management in bizzarre or interesting ways?
		The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy, all of which are interpersonally aversive.[1][2][3] The Dark Triad refers to three theoretically distinct but empirically overlapping personality constructs.[4][5] The term reflects the perception that these three diagnostic categories have at least some common underlying factors:[6][7]
		The narcissistic personality (in the clinical sense) is characterized by a grandiose self-view, a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, and egotism. Some theories, such as those of Heinz Kohut, associate it with the protection of a radically weak, shamed, or damaged self.[8]
		The Machiavellian personality is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, with a cynical disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and deception.[9]
		The psychopathic personality is characterized by impulsive thrill-seeking, and in its "primary" form by selfishness, callousness, lack of personal affect, superficial charm, and remorselessness.

	How to update your password hashing algorithm on a LIVE server
		http://www.phptherightway.com/#password_hashing
		<p>Probably need a moment of downtime as you fiddle with your database, I have a few lines in my .htaccess that I can uncomment that routes traffic to a friendly maintenance page.</p>
		<p>I'd complete ALL steps on my DEV server, push LIVE (with maintenance page), patch LIVE DB, remove maintenance page.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add an extra column: password_old</li>
			<li>Copy over the current passwords: UPDATE `users` SET `password_old` = `password`;</li>
			<li>NULL the now master password column: UPDATE `users` SET `password` = NULL; (use an arbitrary string if using NOT NULL)</li>
			<li>Update your registration routine to use new algorithm</li>
			<li>Update your login routine to use old AND new algorithms, check both. If user.password == NULL, update to use new algorithm hash</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Run that set and you're in no worse a position than you WERE, however every login populates the new password hash.</p>
		<p>After an arbitrary amount of time, remove the old algorithm altogether (and the `password_old` column), add a new check to the login routine that says "if `password` is NULL, force the user to use the reset password form". For these guys fly it under the banner of "for added security"...</p>

	Prove you can program... Fizz-Buzz!
		<p>After reading &quot;Imran on Tech &gt; </span><a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">Using Fizz-Buzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding</a>&quot; I felt the urge to quickly doodle a Fizz-Buzz program or two.</p>
		<p>For those who haven't jumped on that link I'll redact the article:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>People with Computer Science degrees fail at simple Programming tests - which makes it a bitch to hire someone decent.</p>
			<p>Separate the wheat from the chaff by asking them to program the childs game Fizz-Buzz for 1-100 on paper.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>He says that it should take a couple of minutes, and that he's seen senior coders take TEN to FIFTEEN minutes to do this. Personally I think this is a 1-minute task. So here goes...</p>

		<p>1m 5s - not too bad, this is how I reckon it broke down</p>
		<ul>
			<li>5s - double check the rules: fizz=3, buzz=5</li>
			<li>15s - code the thing in my head</li>
			<li>45s - grab my archaic quill and realise that pens are bloody slow</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I think a better question might be &quot;given 15 minutes&quot; how many different ways could you write Fizz-Buzz...</p>

	Quit that Programming Language
		I love the Freakonomics book / blog / podcast and after listening to <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/09/30/the-upside-of-quitting-full-transcript/">this episode about quitting</a> I noticed that you can apply the same logic on a much smaller scale.
		While the podcast talks about "big quits" (your job, your religion, your marriage), I believe you can apply the idea to your working routine. This <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/language-war-php-vs-ruby-2/">nettuts article</a> that compares PHP with Ruby on Rails has two evangelists; Ryan Allen and Michael Wales, they both started coding with PHP at about the same time, however Ryan abondoned the PHP ship and picked up Ruby on Rails, Michael stuck at it. What I find interesting is that both argue almost the same points. Can it be that changing programming languages is... dare I say it... trivial?
		I think it is!
