<p><em>This page is a work-in-progress, I generally spend more time developing than shouting about it...</em></p>
<p>
	During my career I have strived to contribute to open-source software and to share my programs and ideas for the
	benefit of the community at large. In doing so I have developed a very powerful &quot;core&quot; set of tools that is
	Project: <abbr title="It's a long story, but the OE = &empty; (an Empty Set) and the RM = Relational Mapping.">OERM</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
	Project: OERM is a system that allows me to manage complex, relational databases (the best kind) in a very straightforward
	manner, all I need to do is define the database schema in code and a seriously powerful set of tools are exposed to me that
	create VERY powerful websites and mobile apps.

<!-- Query Generator -->
<h2>Query Generator</h2>
<p>I can demonstrate the concept of this feature with a real-world example. I was asked a non-trivial question by a client:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;We need to see all Sites related to Contracts that we (an Account) have worked on within a Region, searching for the word 'Durham' and Clustered onto a google map...&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone familiar with SQL queries will know that this <em>naive</em> question would test even the most hardened database engineer. With OERM it's a walk in the park.</p>

	<?php
		$rows = $oerm->select("COUNT(*) AS `TOTAL`")->

				'zoom' => 10,
				'lat_n' => 55.206,
				'lat_s' => 54.694,
				'lng_e' => -1.304,
				'lng_w' => -2.087

<p>Common patterns - boolean should be an unsigned TINYINT(1). FK's should be indexed and setup. Did you forget to Auto-Increment your PK?</p>
