intro: |
  <p>One of the first successful e-learning platforms; I designed and developed the corrodere system in 2007. It is a global leader in its field.</p>
  <p>Managed by a 3rd party, the tech is unchanged.</p>

<p>A bit of ancient history for me, the Corrodere E-Learning platform was my first <em>truly</em> successful project. I designed and developed this back in 2007 for my fathers company, <a href="digitalized.co.uk" target="_blank">Digitalized</a>.</p>
<p>He continues to manage it, with my original code largely unchanged. It is still a highly profitable platform for all involved.</p>
<p>Corrodere is the leading E-Learning platform for the coating-specialist industry. That is, industrial painting and maintenance.</p>
<p>I architected the platform to have a number of features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Can run offline - useful for offshore environments without broadband</li>
	<li>A translation module - the content is available in 8 languages</li>
	<li>A comprehensive user management system</li>
	<li>PDF certificates are generated and issued on the site</li>
	<li>Hundreds of animations explain technical details and hazardous situations</li>
	<li>Thousands of short videos demonstrate techniques and procedures</li>
</ul>
<p>The platform is fully white-labelled - this allows companies to hand-pick modules and units to suit their individual needs. They can then theme their site to fit their branding.</p>
