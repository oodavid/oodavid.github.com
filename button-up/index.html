<p>I made the mobile game Button Up! during a sabbatical from my freelance work. The game is <strong>complete</strong> but never gained traction due to a lack of marketing. This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aoy112Zt1aAylSnO0Gm8IkEhQ5nPouevQMChI61oE50/pub" target="_blank">Google Document</a> gives a breakdown of most of the major components of the game.</p>
<p>You can get the game for Android or iOS at <a href="http://buttonupgame.com/" target="_blank">buttonupgame.com</a>...</p>
