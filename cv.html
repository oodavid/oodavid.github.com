/**
 * Career Overview
 *
 * Give a rundown of my history leaving the reader suitably prepared to 
 * understand my more recent achievements and technical experience.
 */

    I have been writing code since the tender age of 13. My first "app" was a
    Visual Basic form that took two number inputs and spat out a long division
    diagram. I'm not sure I can even do long division any more. After that I
    worked my way through 3D Studio Max, Director, Flash (3+). I found the webby
    ensemble of <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl">LAMP</abbr> and <abbr title="Javascript, CSS, HTML">JaCH</abbr> shortly after and never really looked back.

    Being a whippersnapper I wrote a few clones of the games I loved (Micro-
    Machines, Worms, Lunar Lander, Tetris etc) but eventually found work with my
    father's company drafting illustrations for an american &quot;print and play&quot;
    game. I continued to work closely with my father for many years, he still
    calls on me for his more challenging jobs.

    After a few years of online and offline games I started working for
    more serious clients and decided to try and break the startup scene (thrice)
    with an <a target="_blank" href="http://cogshop.co.uk/">e-commerce</a> company, a <a target="_blank" href="http://1daylater.com/">time-tracking</a> SaaS and a <a target="_blank" href="http://happie.st">social media</a> outfit,
    each with varying degrees of success. I continue to work as a freelancer
    throughout these endevours.

    Most recently my freelance work has seen me design, implement and deploy an
    end-to-end solution for an Asbestos surveying and management company; it
    deals with account management, scheduling, mobile site-work, lab analysis,
    reports generation and inter-company communication. All to fit the strict
    UKAS standards.

    I have a lot of experience in planning projects from concept to execution
    and am comfortable tackling complex ideas and whittling them down to
    manageable, simple solutions. (I have a 10 foot digital whiteboard in my
    lounge for such activities.)

    To date I have only worked on small programming teams, but should be
    comfortable integrating with larger groups.

    // Backend Development

        # Linux etc
            Standard server admin tasks: installation of software via YUM / APT;
            managing services; user administration; working over Telnet / SSH;
            SSL setup etc. Linux is my OS of choice but will be able to pick up
            the same skills in a Windows or Mac environment.
        # Apache
            The basics: installation; .htaccess wizardry; Server-Side-Includes;
            aliases; fundamental security etc. I've never had the need to
            *really* open up Apache configuration but I'm sure it's fine in
            there.
        # PHP
            My main backend language, I've used many frameworks (CodeIgniter,
            Cake, Kohana, Rat) however I tend to custom-build my own
            environments using 3rd party libraries etc as a foundation.
        # MySQL
            Certainly my favourite database. Familiar with setup and admin,
            complex queries (I really like a good SQL statement), indexing,
            spatial indexing, query optimisation, the different storage engines,
            Entity-Relationship design, CLI or GUI skills are fine.
        # MongoDB
            Used this primarily for its geospatial functionality and mapreduce,
            with its (possibly unfair) reputation for being volatile I used
            MySQL in parallel.
        # Couchdb
            Just a tinker, never for production work.
        # Node.js
            Wrote a webserver &amp; socket server for fun, that was nice.
        # Lighttpd &amp; Nginx
            Again, I've tinkered, I still default to Apache when possible.
        # All the other languages
            I've had minimal exposure to Python, Ruby, RoR, ASP, .NET, Memcached
            etc. but given the right opportunity I'll be super happy to learn
            their nuances and port over my current skills.

    // Frontend Development

        # Javascript / jQuery / Moo / prototype etc.
            JS is my strongest language, I've written all sorts: WYSIWYG
            Editors; jQuery Plugins; UI improvements; Templating Engines; Syntax
            Highlighters; Code Editors; A "Tutorial Engine"; Media Players... I
            could go on. A good UI can make or break online software.
        # HTML
            I've always considered well written HTML to be akin to good manners;
            once you've got the jist of it you're set for life: Semantics;
            Naming Conventions; SEO and Templating are all in place.
        # CSS
            With the sizzle engine and zen coding techniques, it's difficult to
            get by without knowing your CSS3! Grid systems, cross-browser
            testing and fixes and optimisation are a given.
        # Flash
            I haven't used this for a few years, but in a previous life I have:
            written 2D games; vector transformations; worked with streaming
            media; etc. With Actionscript being an ECMA-based language akin to
            Javascript I'd be very confident to pick it up again should the
            needs arise.

 * Highlight my useful non-language-specific skills to round off the list of

 */

    // Due Diligence

        # Git
            Day-to-day useage: push; pull; branching; merging; tagging; site
            deployment via git hooks etc. (I've used SVN too, but I'd happily
            not go back down that road)
        # Documentor extraordinairre
            Whether through JavaDoc type tools or by writing something bespoke I
            document my code with the tenacity of someone with terrible memory.
            What was I saying again? Oh yes, I also enjoy writing a good manual
            or guide for the user-facing part of the systems I work on.

    // Business knowledge

        # Agile
            I'm familiar with various aspects of SCRUM / DSDM / XP such as:
            Roles, User-Stories; JEDUF; Timeboxes; Iteration, Sprints, Decision
            Models, Standups etc.; with every team handpicking the "best" bits
            there's always more to learn.
        # Finances, Cashflow and Law
            Having worked freelance and in the startup environment I know my
            share of small-business monetary and legal matters.
        # Of and through my clients
            Although I am focussed on solving problems in the web-world I pride
            myself on being able to "walk around in my clients shoes" and have
            learned a great deal about the businesses that I serve, from marine
            construction (corrodere.com) to asbestos management (lucion.co.uk)
            and rather a lot in-between.

/**
 * My Personality
 *
 * Write about my life outside the office. Briefly.
 */

    I try to keep my days well planned and jam-packed, away from the binary
    bongo I'll be getting messy in the kitchen, cycling, reading, swimming,
    doing DIY, sketching, writing or generally pootling about. I don't watch TV.
    My knowledge of pop culture is abysmal, you don't want me on your pub-quiz
    team.

    I am diligently working my way through my bucket list.
