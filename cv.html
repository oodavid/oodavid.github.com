<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I am a <strong>full-stack</strong> developer, I create systems to solve real-world problems. I do:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mobile Development</strong> - <em>Android and iOS apps</em></li>
	<li><strong>Back End Development</strong> - <em>Hosting, databases and deployment</em></li>
	<li><strong>Front End Work</strong> - <em>Web design</em></li>
</ul>
<p>My skillset means that I excel in creating <strong>Business Operating Systems</strong> - these are used to manage every aspect of running a business.</p>
<p>I'm also available for smaller projects such as mobile app development, project planning, web-design, database design or consultancy. I've taught specialist programming classes at Newcastle University and am quite comfortable giving talks.</p>
<p>I can explain my <strong>Business Operating Systems</strong> face-to-face or on a video-call. There's an element of confidentiality that prevents me from writing in detail about my work in this area.</p>
<p>You can get an insight into my <em>style</em> on my <a href="/projects/">projects page</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical Abilities</h2>
<p>Picking the best tool for the job is a critical part of any project. I like to review the available languages and frameworks on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>For large projects, it can be easy to swallow the &quot;cost&quot; of learning new technologies by reviewing the value on offer. A recent example springs to mind. I had to figure out how to synchronise data between a mobile app and the server - It came down to choosing the right database:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>While I am familiar with MongoDB, MySQL and RDS - CouchDB + PouchDB offers mobile data synchronisation out of the box.</p>
	<p>The cost of learning CouchDB + PouchDB will be lower than dealing with data synchronisation on the databases I already know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many developers have their languages of choice, and use them for everything. I prefer to match the language to the project.</p>
<p>These are the languages and technologies that I've used in production work:</p>
<div id="alltech" class="clearfix">
	{% for image in site.static_files %}
		{% if image.path contains '/assets/tech/' and image.path contains '.png' %}
			<div class="tech">
				<img src="{{ image.path }}" width="64" height="64">
				{{ image.path | remove:'/assets/tech/' | remove:'.png' }}
			</div>
		{% endif %}
	{% endfor %}
</div>
<p><em><strong>NB</strong> - A few of these are whole ecosystems and represent a <em>huge</em> number of technologies. It would be absurd to say &quot;I know AWS&quot;, I'm not sure anyone truly could. I've used their services and systems on a day-to-day basis.</em></p>

<h2>Hands on Experience</h2>
<p>To execute a project successfully, a solid plan must be in place. This often means creating a mockup of the software and having it signed off by the client before wiring it up.</p>
<p>I prefer a slightly different approach. Before I get to the mockup stage, I like to truly understand my clients business and their need for software. I'll give you some real examples:</p>

<h4>Asbestos Management <small>a huge project</small></h4>
<p>I was asked to create a system to collate and deliver asbestos surveys at scale.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I spent 2 weeks studying each department in the company. Some departments weren't formally defined, so we did that as we went:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>higher management
		<li>accounts management</li>
		<li>sales</li>
		<li>laboratory</li>
		<li>admin</li>
		<li>field-work</li>
		<li>fleet management</li>
		<li>finances</li>
	</ul>
	<li>After compiling a process diagram representing the flow of information through company, we then identified key issues and problem areas. By tackling &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; first, I was able to improve cashflow and profitability almost immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Personal Training App <small>a mid-sized project</small></h4>
<p>I was approached by a group of Personal Trainers to create a mobile app. They wanted to deliver curated workouts to their clients.</p>
<p>I asked them to take me on as a client and started training. Over a few training sessions, and a few &quot;normal&quot; meetings we concluded that delivering workouts would erode the experience of a face-to-face training. The app we created was aligned with their business goals and promoted continued training within the group.</p>

<h2>Project Management</h2>
<p>I cherry pick elements of SCRUM, DSDM and Kanban in my project planning. In a small team (often just me) the main requirement is to hit deadlines and keep deliverables in scope. I've been leaning more toward a pure Kanban process over time.</p>
<p>I even use a Kanban board to manage my housework. Don't judge me.</p>

<h2>Complementary Skills</h2>
<p>Whether I'm walking around in my clients shoes or reading about cutting edge technologies I love learning new skills. On my journey so far I've become reasonably proficient in a number of areas outside of programming.</p>

<h4>Writing</h4>
<p>I write in plain English. I have a clear and expressive writing style. This is true of my correspondence, documentation and is even reflected in my code.</p>

<h4>Finances, Cashflow and Law</h4>
<p>I have created systems that handle vast sums of money; somewhere in the order of &pound;100m. In doing so I have learned all about quoting, contracts, invoicing, aged-debt and credit-notes.</p>
<p>The same system even handles salary calculations, expenses and mileage.</p>

<h4>Electronics</h4>
<p>I have recently started teaching myself electronics fundamentals. I could certainly hold my own when talking about PCB design, bill-of-materials, sourcing components and the crazy cost of enclosure manufacturing.</p>

<h4>3D Printing</h4>
<p>I have a <a href="http://formlabs.com/products/3d-printers/form-2/">Form 2 SLA printer</a> which I occasionally use to create product mockups. But mostly just for tinkering!</p>
