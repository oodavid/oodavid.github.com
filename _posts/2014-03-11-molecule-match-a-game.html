title: "Molecule Match, a Game"
---
<p><em>If you're the type of person that hears &quot;maths&quot; or &quot;science&quot; and starts to have a seizure, chill out dude! This is a <strong>game</strong> not an exam paper... <small>although I might cold-call you with spot questions when you lest expect</small></em></p>
<p>For about 2 or 3 years I've been toying with a game concept based on molecular structures, I'll give you the massively redacted brainstory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You know how I <em>really</em> like The Count of Monte Cristo? Yeah.</li>
	<li>Remember that game Chiral? No? Well I do, it was awesome.</li>
	<li>Amateur Psychology makes up a good chunk of my autodidactism.<br><em>Especially addiction and manipulation.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Fuse those themes together</h2>
<p>And you get something that is so impossibly hard to describe, that people run for the hills! And by god I love an up-hill struggle. I'm struggling up that hill to catch the people that run away, so that in my usual upbeat manner I can ramble on at them.</p>
<p>Or I could show a pretty picture...</p>

<p>I've been told this might be an original puzzle dynamic. Which is pretty cool. I'm not omniscient of course, but there's a big empty space in my grey matter where things like this should live.</p>
<h2>Wanna play?</h2>
<p>I've done a very naughty thing by introducing 3 concepts and then showing a daft gif of some brightly colored gubbins; if you trust me (which you should) you can install a pre-alpha on your phone and have a play. Really, this explains waaaay more than I can be bothered to write on my blog.</p>
