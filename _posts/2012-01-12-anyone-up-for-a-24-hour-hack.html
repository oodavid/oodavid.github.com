title: "Anyone up for a 24-hour hack?"

<p>All of life's best bits happen in brief but intense passages of time:</p>
<ul><li>birth</li>
<li>falling in love</li>
<li>earthquakes</li>
<li>godzilla attack</li>
<li>24 hour nerd a'hack</li>
</ul><p><iframe frameborder="0" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fPTJ3qD1ikk" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p><em>beautiful, just lovely</em></p>
<p>So if you're a nerd, designer, animator in Newcastle (or with a railpass) or just like coffee and pizzas you could do worse than sign up to <a href="http://www.culturecode.co.uk">The Culture Code Initiative</a> megahacks and whatnot (a codeworks collaboration).</p>
<p>This isn't your average hack either; I believe the primary goal is to seek out and encourage long-term relationships between the arts and digital sectors (think business deals folks). The hope is to bypass those risky stages and get straight to the meat an potatoes of what can be achieved.</p>
<p>Brilliant people ASSEMBBLLLLLEEEEE!!</p>
