<p>So lets put all our cards on the table and try to work through all the wants, needs, complaints and potential outcomes:</p>
<h3>The solution must...</h3>
<ul>
	<li>...be technically viable - use our existing infrastructure</li>
	<li>...be inexpensive - economically speaking, a costly solution would be passed to the consumer</li>
	<li>...protect our children - WHEN and IF we want it to</li>
	<li>...protect our freedoms</li>
	<li>...be simple enough to evolve - Just your basic Agile stuff</li>
	<li>...be open source</li>
</ul>
