I love the Freakonomics book / blog / podcast and after listening to <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/09/30/the-upside-of-quitting-full-transcript/">this episode about quitting</a> I noticed that you can apply the same logic on a much smaller scale.

While the podcast talks about "big quits" (your job, your religion, your marriage), I believe you can apply the idea to your working routine. This <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/general/language-war-php-vs-ruby-2/">nettuts article</a> that compares PHP with Ruby on Rails has two evangelists; Ryan Allen and Michael Wales, they both started coding with PHP at about the same time, however Ryan abondoned the PHP ship and picked up Ruby on Rails, Michael stuck at it. What I find interesting is that both argue almost the same points. Can it be that changing programming languages is... dare I say it... trivial?

I think it is!
