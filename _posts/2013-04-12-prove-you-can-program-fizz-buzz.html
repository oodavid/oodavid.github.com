<p>After reading &quot;Imran on Tech &gt; </span><a href="http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">Using Fizz-Buzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding</a>&quot; I felt the urge to quickly doodle a Fizz-Buzz program or two.</p>
<p>For those who haven't jumped on that link I'll redact the article:</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
<p>I think a better question might be &quot;given 15 minutes&quot; how many different ways could you write Fizz-Buzz...</p>
