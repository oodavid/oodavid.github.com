<p>Stone Soup is a folk tale that our Grandad used to tell us as children, it's about a little old biddy who persuades a community to come together and make &quot;stone soup&quot; on the grounds that it's &quot;only a stone and hot water&quot;... of course once the salt, pepper, potatoes, onions, mutton, carrots, split-peas, stock, turnips, celery, cream and barley are added the stone soup is truly successful.</p>
<p>It's also a lie.</p>

<p>I have carried around the anology for years, I use it to describe how complex software evolves from it's simple stone and water conception to it's final broth rich with flavours.</p>
<p>There are clients that are too naive or ignorant to understand what they want and believe in their own &quot;simple&quot; demands, and then there are clients that know <em>exactly</em> the complex broth they want and are using the &quot;simple&quot; starting point to trick you into making it.</p>
